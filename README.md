## Fail

Ideas to fail better with Clojure

### Requirements
- Java 11+
- Clojure [CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools)
- [Babashka](https://babashka.org/)

### Running tests
- Install a recent version of docker
- `bb test` to execute all the tests

### Building the jar
- `bb compile` to have the `fail.jar` which can be executed directly
